This project wants to be a Free and Open Source Software for storing and retrieving caller information.

Why?
----

Because there is no free and open source software that allows to store, query and share caller information: this is even more important in a world where Robocalls and Scam calls are getting more and more common.

What about STIR/SHAKEN?
-----------------------

STIR/SHAKEN is intended to mainly combat caller ID spoofing (and eventually reduce spam calls), but it won't do much for all those services that have taken a hold of your phone number and want to sell something to you, or ask questions for a survey, or who knows what.

Having a Crowdsourced database labelling a certain phone number is still invaluable, even just to have an idea of who may be hiding behind a phone number.
